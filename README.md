# Multi-Dimensional-Data-Visualizer-VR
Multidimensional Data is compressed using PCA and displayed in 3D using VR
This project was last opened in unity version 5.5.1f1(64 bit)
This project will allow a person to compress any multidimensional data into 3 dimensional data using PCA and represent it in VR using google cadboard. A person can walk through data and look around it. So it can be used to analyze multidimensional data in a more interactive manner.
One tap walk/stopWalk has been implemented, so you will move in the direction in which you are looking when you tap the screen and if you tap again you will stop moving.
